/* If using [innerHTML] and you want to style content within it,
   you might need to use ::ng-deep or ensure your Tailwind prose plugin handles it.
   For example, to ensure paragraphs within the prose have some margin: */
:host ::ng-deep .prose p {
  margin-top: 0.5em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}

/* You can add custom styles for the jumbotron effect if needed,
   but Tailwind classes in the HTML should cover most of it. */
