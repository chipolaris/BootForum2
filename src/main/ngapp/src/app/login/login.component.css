  This file can often be empty when using Tailwind CSS extensively.
  Add custom styles here only if they cannot be achieved with Tailwind utilities
  or require more complex selectors/features.

  Example (if needed):
  .custom-complex-gradient {
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, var(--tw-gradient-stops));
  }
